The **[Open Definition](/od/)** sets out principles that define "openness" in relation to **data and content**.

It makes **precise** the meaning of "open" in the terms **"open data"** and **"open content"** and thereby encourages **interoperability** between different pools of open material.

It can be summed up in the statement that:

> "Knowledge is open if **anyone** is **free to access, use, modify, and share it** — subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness."
