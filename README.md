Git repo for the <http://OpenDefinition.org/> website including
the Open Definition (OD) and Open Software Service Definition (OSSD).

The current OD version is 1.1. Numerous translations are available
on the website. The ideal way to submit new translations is by adding
an `od/{language code}/index.markdown` file and sending a pull request.

The current OSSD version is 1.1, translations to
`software-service/{language code}/index.markdown`

Also see the related <http://licenses.opendefinition.org/> and its source
repository. Eventually these two sites and repositories will probably be
merged.
