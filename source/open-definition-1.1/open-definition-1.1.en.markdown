Version WILDLY EXPERIMENTAL

## TODO

1. remove "shall"; use "is" instead
2. consider adding criteria for recommended licenses: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/is%3Asent+to%3Aod-discuss%40lists.okfn.org/13d83b21993b1a1c
3. consider criteria rejecting jurisdiction-specific licenses: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/is%3Asent+to%3Aod-discuss%40lists.okfn.org/13f2fcff02db0ef6
3. review http://opendefinition.org/licenses/process/ to see if parallel fixes necessary

## Terminology

The term **knowledge** is taken to include:

  1. Content such as music, films, books
  2. Data be it scientific, historical, geographic or otherwise
  3. Government and other administrative information

Software is excluded despite its obvious centrality because it is already
adequately addressed by previous work.

The term **work** will be used to denote the item or piece of knowledge
which is being transferred.

The term **package** may also be used to denote a collection of works. Of
course such a package may be considered a work in itself.

The term **license** refers to the legal license under which the work is
made available. Where no license has been made this should be interpreted
as referring to the resulting default legal conditions under which the
work is available (for example copyright).

## The Definitions

### Open License Definition

A license is open if its terms satisfy the following conditions:

### 1. Redistribution

The terms do not restrict any party from selling or giving away the
work either on its own or as part of a package made from works from many
different sources. The terms do not require a royalty or other fee
for such sale or distribution.

### 2. Reuse

The terms allow for modifications and derivative works, and
allow them to be distributed under the terms of the original work.

*Comment: Note that this clause does not prevent the use of 'viral'
or share-alike licenses that require redistribution of modifications
under the same terms as the original.*

### 3. Attribution

The license may require as a condition for redistribution and re-use
the attribution of the contributors and creators to the work. If this
condition is imposed it must not be onerous. For example if attribution is
required a list of those requiring attribution should accompany the work.

### 4. Integrity

The license may require as a condition for the work being distributed in
modified form that the resulting work carry a different name or version
number from the original work.

### 5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups

The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.

*Comment: In order to get the maximum benefit from the process, the
maximum diversity of persons and groups should be equally eligible to
contribute to open knowledge. Therefore we forbid any open-knowledge
license from locking anybody out of the process.*

*Comment: this is taken directly from item 5 of the OSD.*

### 6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor

The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the work in a
specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the work
from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.

*Comment: The major intention of this clause is to prohibit license
traps that prevent open material from being used commercially. We want
commercial users to join our community, not feel excluded from it.*

*Comment: this is taken directly from item 6 of the OSD.*

### 7. Distribution of License

The rights attached to the work must apply to all to whom it is
redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license
by those parties.

*Comment: This clause is intended to forbid closing up knowledge by
indirect means such as requiring a non-disclosure agreement.*

*Comment: this is taken directly from item 7 of the OSD.*

### 8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Package

The rights attached to the work must not depend on the work being part
of a particular package. If the work is extracted from that package and
used or distributed within the terms of the work's license, all parties
to whom the work is redistributed should have the same rights as those
that are granted in conjunction with the original package.

*Comment: this is taken directly from item 8 of the OSD.*

### 9. License Must Not Restrict the Distribution of Other Works

The license must not place restrictions on other works that are
distributed along with the licensed work. For example, the license must
not insist that all other works distributed on the same medium are open.

*Comment: Distributors of open knowledge have the right to make their
own choices. Note that 'share-alike' licenses are conformant since those
provisions only apply if the whole forms a single work.*

*Comment: this is taken directly from item 9 of the OSD.*

### Open Work Definition

A work is open if its manner of distribution satisfies the following
conditions:

### 1. License

The work is available under an open license, as defined above, and 
recipients of the work are clearly and unambigously notified of the 
license. Any additional terms accompanying the work (such as a terms
of use) do not contradict the terms of the license.

### 2. Access

The work shall be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable
reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet without
charge. The work must also be available in a convenient and modifiable
form.

*Comment: This can be summarized as 'social' openness - not only are
you allowed to get the work but you can get it. 'As a whole' prevents
the limitation of access by indirect means, for example by only allowing
access to a few items of a database at a time.*

### 3. Absence of Technological Restriction

The work must be provided in such a form that there are no technological
obstacles to the performance of the above activities. This can be
achieved by the provision of the work in an open data format, i.e. one
whose specification is publicly and freely available and which places
no restrictions monetary or otherwise upon its use.
