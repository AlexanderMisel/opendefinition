# Open Definition
Version 2.0dev?

The Open Definition makes precise the meaning of "open" with respect to knowledge, promoting a robust commons in which anyone may participate, and interoperability is maximized.

**Summary:** *Knowledge is open if anyone is free to use, modify, and redistribute it â€” subject only, at most, to requirements to attribute and share-alike.*

This essential meaning is the same as that of "open" with respect to software, contained in the [Open Source Definition](http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd), and is synonymous with "free" or "libre"; see the [Definition of Free Cultural Works](http://freedomdefined.org). The Open Definition was initially derived from the Open Source Definition, which in turn was derived from the [Debian Free Software Guidelines](http://www.debian.org/social_contract).

The term **work** will be used to denote the item or piece of knowledge
which is being transferred.

The term **license** refers to the legal terms under which the work is
made available. Where no license has been offered this should be interpreted
as referring to default legal conditions governing use of the work (for 
example, copyright).

### 1. Open Works

A specific **work** is open if its manner of distribution satisfies the following
requirements.

##### 1.1 Open License

The **work** *must* be available under an open **license** (as defined in Section 1).
Any additional terms accompanying the work (such as a terms of use) *must not* 
contradict the terms of the license.

##### 1.2 Access

The **work** shall be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable 
one-time reproduction cost, preferably downloadable via the Internet without charge.
Any additional information necessary for license compliance (such as names of 
contributors required for compliance with attribution requirements) *must* also 
accompany the work.

##### 1.3 Open Format

The **work** *must* be provided in a convenient and modifiable form such
that there are no unnecessary technological obstacles to the performance of the
licensed rights. Specifically, data should be machine-readable, available in
bulk and provided in an open format (i.e., one whose specification is publicly
and freely available and which places no restrictions, monetary or otherwise, upon
its use) or, at the very least, can be processed with at least one free/open source
software tool.


### 2. Open Licenses

A **license** is open if its terms satisfy the following conditions.

#### 2.1 Required Permissions

The **license** *must* irrevocably grant the following permissions.

##### 2.1.1 Use

The **license** *must* allow use of the licensed work.

##### 2.1.2 Redistribution

The **license** *must* allow redistribution of the licensed work, 
including sale, either on its own or as part of a collection made from 
works from different sources.

##### 2.1.3 Reuse

The **license** *must* allow creation of derivatives of the licensed 
work, and *must* allow the derivatives to be distributed under the 
terms of the original licensed work.

##### 2.1.4 Separation

The **license** *must* allow any part of the work, or the whole of it, 
to be used, distributed or modified separately from any other part 
of the work, or from any collection of works in which it was originally 
distributed. When a work or any part of a work is used or redistributed 
within the terms of the license, all parties to whom the work is redistributed 
should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with 
the original work.

##### 2.1.5 Compilation

The **license** *must* allow the licensed work to be distributed along 
with other distinct works, with no restrictions placed on these other works.

##### 2.1.6 Impartiality
The **license** *must* treat all persons or groups of persons equally.

##### 2.1.7 Propagation
The rights attached to the work *must* apply to all to whom it is redistributed 
without the need to agree to any additional legal terms.

##### 2.1.8 Application to Any Purpose

The **license** *must* allow use, redistribution, modification and 
compilation for any purpose. The 
license *must not* restrict anyone from making use of the work in a
specific field of endeavor.

##### 2.1.9 No Charge

The **license** *must not* impose any fee arrangement, royalty, or other
compensation or monetary remuneration as part of its conditions.

#### 2.2 Acceptable Conditions
The **license** *may* condition the permissions granted in Section 2.1 on 
compliance with the following conditions. Other conditions are not 
permitted if they limit, make uncertain, or otherwise diminish the permissions 
required in Section 2.1.

##### 2.2.1 Attribution

The **license** *may* require that contributors, rights holders, sponsors and creators of a licensed 
work be attributed in distributed versions of the work. If this condition 
is imposed, it *must not* be onerous. 

##### 2.2.2 Integrity

The **license** *may* require that modified versions of a licensed work
carry a different name or version number from the original work, or 
otherwise indicate what changes have been made. 

##### 2.2.3 Share-alike

The **license** *may* require that copies or derivatives of a licensed work be
released under a license the same as or similar to the original.
