# Open Definition
Version 2.0dev?

## Introduction

The Open Definition makes precise the meaning of "open" with respect to data and content, promoting a robust knowledge commons in which anyone may participate and innovate, and in which barriers to interoperability among pools of data and content are minimized.

Summary: **Data or content is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it — subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike.**

This essential meaning is the same as that of "open" with respect to software, contained in the [Open Source Definition](http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd), and is synonymous with "free" or "libre"; see the [Definition of Free Cultural Works](http://freedomdefined.org). The Open Definition was initially derived from the Open Source Definition, which in turn was derived from the [Debian Free Software Guidelines](http://www.debian.org/social_contract).

## Terminology

The term **work** will be used to denote the item or piece of knowledge
which is being transferred.

The term **license** refers to the legal terms under which the work is
made available. Where no license has been made this should be interpreted
as referring to the resulting default legal conditions under which the
work is available (for example copyright).

### 1. Open Licenses

A **license** is open if its terms satisfy the following conditions:

#### 1.1 Required Permissions

The **license** *must* irrevocably grant the following permissions.

##### 1.1.1 Use

The **license** *must* allow use of the licensed work.

    HL: formerly addressed by "8. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor"

##### 1.1.2 Redistribution

The **license** *must* allow redistribution of the licensed work, 
including sale, either on its own or as part of a collection made from 
works from many different sources. The license *must* not require a 
royalty or other fee for such sale or distribution.

    HL: formerly addressed by "2. Redistribution"

##### 1.1.3 Reuse

The **license** *must* allow creation of derivatives of the licensed 
work, and *must* allow the derivatives to be distributed under the 
terms of the original licensed work.

*Comment: Conditions may be placed on this permission, as described 
below. Common conditions include 'copyleft' or share-alike requirements 
that require redistribution of modifications under the same terms as the original.*

    HL: formerly addressed by "3. Reuse"

##### 1.1.4 Separation

The **license** *must* allow any part of the work, or the whole of it, 
to be used, distributed or modified separately from any other part 
of the work, or from any collection of works in which it was originally 
distributed. 

    HL: formerly addressed by "10. License *must* Not Be Specific to a Package"
    HL: not sure this covers everything that clause 10 currently addresses.


##### 1.1.5 Compilation

The **license** *must* allow the licensed work to be distributed along 
with other distinct works, with no restrictions placed on these other works.

_Comment: For example, the license must not insist that all other works distributed on the same medium are open._

_Comment: Distributors of open knowledge have the right to make their own choices. Note that ‘share-alike’ licenses are conformant since those provisions only apply if the whole forms a single work._

_Comment: this is taken directly from item 9 of the OSD._

    HL: formerly addressed by "11. License Must Not Restrict the Distribution of Other Works"

##### 1.1.6 Impartiality
The **license** *must* treat all persons or groups of persons equally.

_Comment: In order to get the maximum benefit from the process, the maximum diversity of persons and groups should be equally eligible to contribute to open knowledge. Therefore we forbid any open-knowledge license from locking anybody out of the process._

_Comment: this is derived from item 5 of the OSD._

    HL: formerly addressed by "7. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups"

##### 1.1.7 Propagation
The rights attached to the work *must* apply to all to whom it is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.

_Comment: This clause is intended to forbid closing up knowledge by indirect means such as requiring a non-disclosure agreement._

_Comment: this is derived from item 7 of the OSD._

    HL: formerly addressed by "9. Distribution of License"


##### 1.1.8 Application to Any Purpose

The **license** *must* allow use, redistribution, modification and 
compilation, by any person or group of persons, for any purpose.

_Comment: The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the work in a
specific field of endeavor.  For example, it may not restrict the work from being
used in a business, or from being used for genetic research._

_Comment: The major intent of this clause is to prohibit license traps that prevent open
material from being used commercially.  We want commercial users to join our community, not
feel excluded from it._

_Comment: this is adapted from item 6 of the OSD._

    HL: formerly addressed by "8. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor"


##### 1.1.9 No Charge

The **license** *must* not impose any fee arrangements, compensation or monetary 
remuneration as part of it's conditions. The only charge that may be made is for 
any one-off reproduction cost, in the common case of downloading over the internet 
the this cost would normally be zero.


#### 1.2 Acceptable Conditions
The **license** *may* condition the permissions granted in Section 1.1 on 
compliance with the following conditions. Other conditions are not generally 
permitted if they meaningfully limit or otherwise impact the permissions 
required in Section 1.1.

##### 1.2.1 Attribution

The **license** may require that contributors and creators of a licensed 
work be attributed in distributed versions of the work. If this condition 
is imposed it *must* not be onerous. 

    LV: "onerous" is vague.

    KM: Still maybe not quite there, but perhaps something along the 
    lines of "If this condition is imposed, it must not unnecessarily 
    burden the use of alternative formats or alternative means of distribution".

    HL: formerly addressed by "5. Attribution"

##### 1.2.2 Integrity

The **license** may require that modified versions of a licensed work *must* 
carry a different name or version number from the original work, or 
otherwise indicate what changes have been made. 

    LV: We should consider broadening to cover everything related to 
    trademarks, in line with recent licenses. (Same issue was noted 
    by Stefano Zacchiroli in his email to us.)

    HL: formerly addressed by "6. Integrity"

##### 1.2.3 Share-alike

The **license** may require that copies or adaptations of a licensed work be
released under the same or similar license as the original.




### 2. Open Works

A specific **work** is open if its manner of distribution satisfies the following
conditions:

#### 2.1 Mandatory Conditions

##### 2.1.1 Open License

The **work** *must* be available under an open license, as defined above, and 
recipients of the work *must* be clearly and unambiguously notified of the 
license. Any additional terms accompanying the work (such as a terms
of use) must not contradict the terms of the license. Any additional 
information necessary for license compliance (such as names of contributors 
required for compliance with attribution requirements) should also accompany 
the work.

    HL: this is new and required to link to the license section

##### 2.1.2 Access

The **work** shall be available as a whole and at no more than a
reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloadable via the Internet
without charge. The **work** *must* also be available in a convenient and
modifiable form. The **license** may require the work to be available
in a convenient and modifiable form. The **work** *must* be clearly presented
as available under the **license**.

*Comment: This can be summarized as 'social' openness - not only are you
allowed to use, modify, and share the work but you can get it. 'As a whole'
prevents the limitation of access by indirect means, for example by only
allowing access to a few items of a database at a time. An example of
'reasonable reproduction cost' is the cost of blank media or bandwidth
required to distribute a complete database. 'Clearly presented as
available' means that both the license and the means of access are clear
and unambiguous on which works the rights attach to.*

    HL: formerly addressed by "1. Acesss"
    HL: I would like to see any references to licensing moved up to section 1

##### 2.1.3 Open Format

The **work** *must* be provided in such a form that there are no
technological obstacles to the performance of the licensed rights. This
can be achieved by the provision of the work in an open data format,
i.e., one whose specification is publicly and freely available and which
places no restrictions monetary or otherwise upon its use. 

    LV: not clear that "open data formats" are necessarily technologically 
    unencumbered (I know of at least three "open" DRM standards).
    
    LV: It might make sense to link, at least in a comment, to an open 
    standard definition; e.g., http://opensource.org/osr

    HL: formerly addressed by "4. Absence of Technological Restriction"


### Other TODOs

* review http://opendefinition.org/licenses/process/ and make any necessary changes there
* should works section come first? it's shorter, less obscure, and contextualizes/motivates (or could/ought) licenses
    * LV: I think not; we're not ever going to be in the business of certifying works, and it will always have to refer to licenses. If it should be moved anywhere, I'd put it in a different document.
* most of the explanatory comments are gone. maybe the remaining ones should too, and each point be fully self-explanatory
    * LV: That should certainly be a goal.
* address non-revocability/perpetual license [explicitly](https://twitter.com/owenboswarva/status/409801832869797888)? added "irrevocably" before "grant the following permissions".
