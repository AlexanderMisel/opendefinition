##### 1.1.9 Privacy

    (kfogel added this as a suggestion, on 2013-12-03)

The **license** must allow private study, use, and modification in the absence
of any form of distribution.  The license may name certain requirements as
conditions for distribution, but the license must not compel distribution itself.

    In other words, if a license requires share-alike style redistribution, the sharealike
    terms must not compel distribution in the first place.  If someone distributes at all,
    it is reasonable to require that they not place obstacles in the way of downstream
    recipients, and even reasonable to require certain forms of active cooperation (e.g.,
    the AGPL's view that accessing functionality via a network is a form of distribution).
    However, if someone does *not* distribute at all, then the license must not compel it.
    The reasons for this are probably obvious, but if pressed for a reference about the
    importance of privacy, I guess I'd point to the first paragraph in which the word
    "privacy" is used in http://snowdenandthefuture.info/PartIII.html.

    HL: this is new (as noted above)

 
##### 1.2.3 Access and Restrictions

The **license** may require the work to be available in a conveniently 
modifiable form. The license may prohibit technological restrictions.

    HL: this is new


#### 1.3 Recommendations for Open Licenses

    NB: This section is still completely a work in progress, and may or may not be adopted.
    
Licenses with the following characteristics help the open ecosystem by maintaining interoperability and avoiding high costs. (If AC and approval are mentioned in this document, might say we don't approve licenses not following these recommendations.)

##### Indpendence?

These rights *must* apply independently of other legal agreements, without any 
obligation to agree to additional terms. 

    LV: On re-reading, I'm not sure the "independently of other legal agreements" 
    is quite right; it is broader than the old equivalent language and would 
    prohibit (say) CC 4.0, which reserves rights not explicitly included in the license. 

#### Reusable

Not specific to an organization or jurisdiction.

#### Compatible

With? Should some license(s) be baked in?

#### Coverage

Something about granting rights to something substantial and clear? eg not only game rules

#### Understandable

If AC has to debate what license really means, it isn't understandable. Is there some way to express this generally?
 
 
#### 2.2 Recommendations for Open Works

    KM: We should have a discussion about this on-list, but I'm thinking
    it could be useful to have some softer **should** conditions regarding
    archiving, metadata, use of open standards, availability of APIs, etc.
