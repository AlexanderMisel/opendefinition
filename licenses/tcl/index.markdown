 * Domain of Application: Data.

WARNING: the TCL is in the process of being replaced by the [Open Database License](http://www.opencontentlawyer.com/open-data/open-database-licence/) developed by Jordan Hatcher and Charlotte Waelde and released on the 2007-09-24. As of 2007-10-22 this was still in beta state but could still be usuable (it is one of the most thorough DB-specific licenses developed so far).

#### Comments 

The TCL currently exists only in draft form. The TCL is explicitly intended to address the protection of *data'' in line with the European notion of a [Database Right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_right), as opposed to the Copyright protections afforded to ''creative works* by the majority of equivalent licenses.

#### How to apply 

Include a link to, or a full copy of the TCL in your work, and something like the following:
