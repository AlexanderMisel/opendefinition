The **[Open Definition](/od/)** sets out principles that define "openness" in relation to **data and content**.





It makes **precise** the meaning of "open" in the terms **"open data"** and **"open content"** and thereby ensures **interoperability** between different pools of open material.





It can be summed up in the statement that:





<blockquote>"A piece of data or content is open if **anyone** is **free to use, reuse, and redistribute** it -- subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike."
